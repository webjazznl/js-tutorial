    <h1>Henk Siebelink</h1>
    <h2>Your old school web developer of the next generation...</h2>
    <p>I am into web development for more than 15 years. I tought myself a lot 
        of different back end technologies and frameworks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Classic ASP with VBScript</li>
        <li>ColdFusion (yes, it is still in use...)</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS (of course)</li>
        <li>ASP.NET with C#(even!...)</li>
        <li>Visual Basic (once in a blue moon...)</li>
        <li>Microsoft Dynamics CRM (I forgot about that completely)</li>
        <li>PHP (from 5.6 to 7.0)</li>
        <li>Drupal (7.0 and 8.0)</li>
        <li>A little ZEND framework</li>
        <li>And some Symfony</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I also learned to use a lot of different editors with these 
        technologies.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Homesite 4.5 (who remembers that one?)</li>
        <li>Notepad++</li>
        <li>Visual Studio 2008</li>
        <li>Sublime Text 2 and 3</li>
        <li>Atom.io</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I ended up knowing a little about a lot, never really excelling in any
        of the listed platforms. Summer 2018 I decided to do 
    away with *all* of them and use just one combination:</p>

    <h3><i>JavaScript</i> with <i>Visual Studio Code</i></h3>
